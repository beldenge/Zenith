# Description
This module encompasses the algorithm which performs inference on the language model.

# Running
1. Download and install Java 8 (JDK 11 has been tested successfully but found to perform more poorly)
2. On the command line, change to the zenith-inference directory
3. Issue the command `java -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2 -Xms2G -Xmx2G -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512M -jar zenith-inference\target\zenith-inference-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar`

Note: You must run the *-exec.jar and not the vanilla jar file, as this module is used both as a dependency and as a runnable application on its own.

# Architecture

There are three major levels of customization:
1. Optimizer
   - SimulatedAnnealingSolutionOptimizer
     - This is the optimizer which currently is successful and is recommended (and is the default).
   - GeneticAlgorithmSolutionOptimizer
     - This is an experimental optimizer that does not yet produce successful solutions.
2. Transformer (listed below in [Transformer Implementations](#transformer-implementations))
3. PlaintextEvaluator
   - MarkovModelPlaintextEvaluator
     - This evaluator is explained below in [Algorithm and Scoring](#algorithm-and-scoring)
   - RestServicePlaintextEvaluator
     - You can implement an evaluator in any technology you want, as long as it conforms to the predefined REST interface.  Just point to that service using the property ```evaluation.rest-service.url```. 

# Configuration
Ciphers need to be configured as JSON, each in a separate file that is readable from the property working directory in a subdirectory called "ciphers".  Out of the box, the zodiac408 and zodiac340 ciphers are packaged within the application.
Take a look at [ciphers.json](src/main/resources/ciphers/zodiac408.json) for an example.

There are a number of configuration settings that can be set for the application.  They need to be put in an application.properties file in the same directory as where you are running the application from.

# Algorithm and Scoring
This applies to the SimulatedAnnealingSolutionOptimizer.

The algorithm is standard hill climbing with random restarts and an annealing schedule to aid in convergence.  Many other more complex types of algorithms have been attempted, but they have been found to either be unsuccessful or too slow.  Furthermore, the simplest solution that works is most often the best solution. 

The solution scoring works by using a language model to estimate the probability of the solution and then penalizing the solution with a compution of the index of coincidence.  The language model is a Markov model of order 5 whereby any n-grams of the same length can each be assigned probabilities.  For n-grams that occur in solutions and which we do not have a match in the language model, we assign an "unknown n-gram probability".  We convert all probabilties to log probabilities, and this is done both for performance reasons and for ease of penalizing them by the aforementioned index of coincidence.  The index of coincidence turns out to be a critical component, as without it the hill climbing algorithm gets very easily stuck at local optima.  We finally take the fifth root of the index of coincidence and then multiply that by the sum of log probabilities as determined by the language model to get our score for a given solution.

# Transformer Implementations
For ciphers that are more complex than homophonic substitution ciphers read left-to-right as normal, it's assumed that some sort of mutation(s) have been performed to throw off various types of cryptanalysis.  When this is the case, it's anyone's guess as to what type(s) of mutation(s) may have been performed during encipherment.  Therefore Zenith comes with an extensible facility for specifying transformations to perform to "unwrap" the cipher before doing hill climbing.  

The following transformers are provided out of the box.  More can be added by implementing the CipherTransformer interface.
### RemoveFirstRow
Removes the first row of the cipher.
### RemoveLastRow
Removes the last row of the cipher.  This is useful for block ciphers where the last row contains mostly jibberish.
### RemoveFirstColumn
Removes the first column of the cipher.
### RemoveLastColumn
Removes the last column of the cipher.
### Transposition
Transposes the cipher using a configured column key.  The column key should be specified as lowercase alpha characters in parenthesis, e.g. ```Transposition(baconisgood)```
### UnwrapTransposition
Unwraps the transposition on the cipher using a configured column key.  The column key should be specified as lowercase alpha characters in parenthesis, e.g. ```UnwrapTransposition(baconisgood)```
### UpperLeftQuadrant
Replaces the cipher with its upper left quadrant.
### UpperRightQuadrant
Replaces the cipher with its upper right quadrant.
### LowerLeftQuadrant
Replaces the cipher with its lower left quadrant.
### LowerRightQuadrant
Replaces the cipher with its lower right quadrant.
### Reverse
Reverses the cipher
### RotateClockwise
Rotates the cipher clockwise (number of rows and columns are swapped)
### RotateCounterClockwise
Rotates the cipher counter-clockwise (number of rows and columns are swapped)
### FlipHorizontally
Inverts the cipher horizontally (as if looking in a mirror)
### FlipVertically
Inverts the cipher vertically (as if looking in a mirror with your head sideways...?)
### Period
Replaces the cipher with a period shift.  The period number should be specified as an integer in paranthesis, e.g. ```Period(19)```
### UnwrapPeriod
Unwraps the period shift on the cipher.  The period number should be specified as an integer in paranthesis, e.g. ```UnwrapPeriod(19)```
